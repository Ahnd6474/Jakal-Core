# GPU

Graph-first heterogeneous compute runtime skeleton for C++20.

This repository is a small CMake library with examples and tests. It discovers host and OpenCL devices, turns them into structural graphs, builds placement plans from those graphs, and runs a compact set of direct kernels to validate the planner.

It is still an early runtime skeleton, not a production execution stack.

## vision

이 레포의 최종 목표는 저사양 노트북 같은 장비에서도 LLM을 실제로 돌릴 수 있는, 벤더 중립적 이기종 추론 런타임을 만드는 것입니다.

지금의 딥러닝 실행 환경은 대체로 GPU나 NPU 중심으로 설계되어 있고, CPU는 보조 역할로만 쓰이는 경우가 많습니다. 이 프로젝트는 그 전제를 다시 봅니다. CPU를 단순한 보조 장치가 아니라, GPU와 함께 연산을 분담하고 파이프라인을 구성하는 계산 자원으로 다시 쓰고 싶습니다.

특히 관심이 있는 부분은 CPU와 GPU를 섞어서 행렬곱과 토큰 생성 경로를 더 잘게 나누고, 어떤 연산을 어디에 배치해야 실제 환경에서 이득이 나는지 찾는 것입니다. 목표는 "GPU가 없으면 못 도는 구조"를 강화하는 것이 아니라, 제한된 하드웨어에서도 돌아가는 실행 형태를 찾는 것입니다.

또한 특정 회사나 제품군에 묶이지 않는 범용성을 지향합니다. Intel GPU, NVIDIA GPU, 그리고 일반 CPU를 함께 사용할 수 있어야 하고, 가능하다면 DP나 DDP에 가까운 방식으로 장치를 묶어 실험할 수 있어야 합니다. 이 레포는 그런 조합을 구조적으로 표현하고, 계획하고, 실행하는 기반이 되려고 합니다.

이 프로젝트는 당장 압도적인 성능 우위를 증명하는 데만 초점을 두지 않습니다. 성능 이득이 작더라도, 혹은 환경마다 결과가 다르더라도, 실제 장비에서 설치해서 끝까지 돌려볼 수 있는 완성품을 만드는 것이 더 중요합니다. 먼저 확실히 돌아가게 만들고, 그 위에서 CPU와 GPU의 새로운 활용 방법을 검증해 나가는 것이 이 레포의 방향입니다.

## installation

### requirements

- CMake 3.20 or newer
- A C++20 compiler
- An OpenCL runtime or driver if you want OpenCL device discovery and direct OpenCL execution

The project does not need CUDA, Level Zero, or Vulkan SDKs to build. Those backends appear in the toolkit-ranking layer, but native execution for them is not wired up in this tree yet.

### build the project

```powershell
# if you have not cloned the repository yet
# git clone <repo-url>
# cd GPU

cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

The default build creates:

- `gpu_runtime` as a static library
- `gpu_inspect` and `gpu_profile_workloads` example executables
- `gpu_smoke` and `gpu_optimization` test executables

Optional CMake switches:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -DGPU_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DGPU_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
```

## quick start

If you want to use the library from another CMake project, add this repository as a subdirectory and link `gpu::runtime`.

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/GPU)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE gpu::runtime)
```

Minimal C++ example:

```cpp
#include "gpu/runtime.hpp"

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    gpu::Runtime runtime;

    for (const auto& graph : runtime.devices()) {
        std::cout << graph.presentation_name << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

`gpu::Runtime` refreshes hardware during construction, so `devices()` is ready immediately unless you disable all probes.

To inspect the discovered graph and a sample plan from this repository directly:

```powershell
.\build\gpu_inspect.exe
```

On Unix-like shells, run `./build/gpu_inspect` instead.

## what is this repository?

The runtime tries to reason about hardware from structure instead of from labels like "CPU", "GPU", or vendor names. Each discovered device becomes a graph of compute, storage, transfer, and control objects. The planner and execution layers work from that graph and from a workload description.

Right now the library covers four main pieces:

- hardware discovery for the host and OpenCL devices
- graph summarization and cost materialization
- workload planning and execution-graph generation
- direct execution and lightweight validation for a small operation set

The operation set in the current tree includes:

- elementwise map
- reduction
- blocked matmul
- 3x3 convolution
- bilinear resample

Canonical workload presets are also built in for:

- gaming upscaling and post-processing
- vision-style inference
- compact training-step surrogates

## why graph-first planning?

Flat device labels lose the details that actually matter for placement. The planner in this repository scores things like execution width, memory capacity, host-link bandwidth, dispatch cost, synchronization cost, and exposed hierarchy. That makes it possible to talk about:

- how much work should stay on the host
- when unified or coherent memory should matter
- whether sharding is worth the transfer cost
- which structural nodes should be mapped for a given workload

That is the idea being tested here. The code is more useful as an executable model of the architecture than as a finished runtime.

## current status

Implemented today:

- C++20 runtime core in [`include/gpu`](./include/gpu) and [`src`](./src)
- host probe and OpenCL probe
- structural hardware graph with weighted edges
- planner cache and execution cache persistence
- workload graph generation with tensors, dependencies, and lifetimes
- execution-graph construction with residency and transfer schedules
- system-profile-aware optimization policies
- direct host execution
- direct OpenCL execution for the current operation set
- C ABI for device, node, edge, and planning inspection
- examples and tests

Not finished yet:

- real tensor residency and allocator management
- native Level Zero, CUDA, and Vulkan execution backends
- framework bridges for Torch, TensorFlow, or similar runtimes
- full inter-device transfer scheduling backed by native transports
- packaging and install rules for downstream consumption

One detail worth calling out: the toolkit-ranking layer can score OpenCL, Level Zero, CUDA, and Vulkan variants. The runtime probes in this repository still come from the host and OpenCL, and the non-OpenCL GPU backends are currently model-driven rather than native integrations.

## api

### C++ entry points

The main public headers are:

- [`include/gpu/runtime.hpp`](./include/gpu/runtime.hpp)
- [`include/gpu/planner.hpp`](./include/gpu/planner.hpp)
- [`include/gpu/execution.hpp`](./include/gpu/execution.hpp)
- [`include/gpu/workloads.hpp`](./include/gpu/workloads.hpp)
- [`include/gpu/c_api.h`](./include/gpu/c_api.h)

`gpu::Runtime` is the main entry point:

| Method | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `devices()` | Returns the discovered hardware graphs |
| `gpu_toolkit_index()` | Returns ranked backend variants per discovered device |
| `plan(workload)` | Builds or loads a cached placement plan |
| `optimize(workload)` | Builds workload and execution graphs, then picks execution settings |
| `execute(workload)` | Runs the optimized configuration and records validation feedback |

`gpu::RuntimeOptions` lets you:

- disable the host probe or OpenCL probe
- override the plan cache path
- override the execution cache path

`gpu::WorkloadSpec` is the main planning input. It includes:

- workload kind
- working-set size
- host exchange size
- estimated flops
- batch size
- latency sensitivity
- unified-memory preference
- matrix-friendly hint

If you do not want to invent workloads by hand, [`include/gpu/workloads.hpp`](./include/gpu/workloads.hpp) exposes `canonical_workload_presets()`.

### C API

The C API in [`include/gpu/c_api.h`](./include/gpu/c_api.h) exposes a smaller surface:

- `gpu_runtime_create` and `gpu_runtime_destroy`
- `gpu_runtime_refresh`
- `gpu_runtime_device_count` and `gpu_runtime_get_device`
- `gpu_runtime_graph_node_count` and `gpu_runtime_get_graph_node`
- `gpu_runtime_graph_edge_count` and `gpu_runtime_get_graph_edge`
- `gpu_runtime_plan`

`gpu_runtime_plan` is currently a planning API, not a full execution API.

For `gpu_workload_spec.kind`, the C layer currently recognizes these strings:

- `custom`
- `inference`
- `image`
- `tensor`

Other values fall back to `custom`.

### cache files

By default the runtime writes lightweight TSV caches to the system temp directory:

- `gpu_runtime_plan_cache.tsv`
- `gpu_runtime_execution_cache.tsv`
- `gpu_runtime_execution_cache.tsv.perf`

You can redirect those files through `gpu::RuntimeOptions`.

## examples

### inspect discovered hardware and a sample workload

```powershell
.\build\gpu_inspect.exe
```

This prints:

- discovered hardware graphs
- graph nodes and edges
- ranked toolkit variants
- a sample plan
- optimization and direct-execution summaries

The output can get large on machines with detailed OpenCL graphs.

### run canonical workload presets

```powershell
.\build\gpu_profile_workloads.exe
```

This example runs the built-in gaming, inference, and training-style presets and prints warm-versus-cold execution summaries. It is the slowest example in the repository because it executes each preset more than once to exercise the learning cache.

### run the tests

If `ctest` is available in your shell:

```powershell
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Or run the test executables directly:

```powershell
.\build\gpu_smoke.exe
.\build\gpu_optimization.exe
```

A recent `gpu_smoke` run ended with:

```text
Graphs=1 allocations=1 operations=5 executed=5 cache=hit
```

A recent `gpu_optimization` run ended with:

```text
operations=5 cached=yes graphs=1 graph_passes=6
```

Treat those numbers as sanity checks, not fixed golden values across every machine.
